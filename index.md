## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in mathematical physics at [IST Austria](https://ist.ac.at/en/home/) in the group of [Robert Seirinnger](https://ist.ac.at/en/research/seiringer-group/).

## Research Interests

I am interested in the mathematics of many-body quantum systems. 
More specifically, in my PhD project I study the ground state energy of a dilute spin-polarized Fermi gas.

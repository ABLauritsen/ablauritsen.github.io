## About Me

Since November 2024, I am a postdoctoral researcher at Université Paris Dauphine in the group of Mathieu Lewin. 
Prior to this, I did my Ph.D. at IST Austria with Robert Seiringer and 
my M.Sc. at the University of Copenhagen with Jan Philip Solovej.


My research interests are within the mathematics of many-body quantum systems
and effective theories thereof.
